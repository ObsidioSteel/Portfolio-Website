    <h1>These are my goals:</h1>
    <p>1. I would like to commit to my Github at least once a day, where I learn at least one thing every day.</p>
    <p>2. I would like to update this website along my journey of basic web development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript to learn the fundamentals.</p>
    <p>3. Later on, by the end of the summer, I would like to have started using the Riot API to make a League of Legends client similar to Mobalytics.</p>
    <p>4. I want to be able to finish a short game, short book, and a short film using Godot and Blender3D, as with any other things I might need.</p>
